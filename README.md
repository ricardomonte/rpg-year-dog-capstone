# Dog Years Phaser Game

- Dog Years is an RPG-type game build based on  ["Dog Years," A Metaphor for Depression by Illustrator Kaye Blegvad](https://www.booooooom.com/2017/11/24/dog-years-a-metaphor-for-depression-by-illustrator-kaye-blegvad/). It about a girl that fights every day against her black dog. I wanted to work around this idea because it's something that is near to me. And probably near to everyone.
